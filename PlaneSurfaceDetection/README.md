Setting up the environment for PlaneRCNN
------------------------------------------
On setting up the environment for PlaneRCNN, see
https://github.com/NVlabs/planercnn

**Note:** You do not have to clone the NVlabs/planercnn repo since all the code is already contained in this repo

ADF distribution propagation 
--------------------------------------------

[ADF distribution propagation for replacing torch.nn modules](./contrib/adf.py) was downloaded from the original [uncertainty_estimation_deep_learning repo](https://github.com/mattiasegu/uncertainty_estimation_deep_learning)

To run inference for planercnn with ADF distribution propagation
------------------------------------------------------------------

 In [visualize_utils.py](visualize_utils.py) import modules from models_adf (Comment line 16 and uncomment line 17)
 
 In [evaluate_utils.py](evaluate_utils.py)  import modules from models_adf  (Comment line 10 and uncomment line 11)
 
``` 
python evaluate_adf.py --methods=f --suffix=warping_refine --dataset=inference --customDataFolder=example_images
```
